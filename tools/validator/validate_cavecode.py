### `tools/validator/validate_cavecode.py`

Use the same script you already put in Arcade Planet (copy/paste).  
If you want it again here, you can reuse the exact version I gave earlier.

# Forgebot (Reserved for Future Automation)

This folder is reserved for tools that operate *on* CaveCode documents:

- scaffold new files from templates
- split / join large CaveCode monoliths
- generate code shells (HTML/JS, Python, etc.) from CaveCode

For v1.0 of the protocol, this folder is intentionally light.

Future versions (v1.1+) may define reference Forgebot behaviors, but the
core protocol does not depend on them.
