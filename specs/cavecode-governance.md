# CaveCode Governance (v1.0)

This document describes how the CaveCode protocol evolves.

---

## 1. Stewardship

The primary steward of CaveCode is:

- **SageWire Syndicate** (project identity)
- with authorship attributed to the original forgemaster(s)
  operating under the VoidWalker / SageWire banners.

Stewardship here means:

- maintaining the spec
- publishing new versions
- keeping glyph meanings stable
- curating official examples

---

## 2. Versioning

Versions follow a simple pattern:

- `v1.0` — Initial stable specification
- `v1.1`, `v1.2` — Backwards-compatible refinements
- `v2.0` — Potentially breaking changes (not expected soon)

Drafts are stored as:

- `cavecode-spec-v1.1-draft.md`
- `cavecode-spec-v2.0-draft.md`

Once approved, they become:

- `cavecode-spec-v1.1.md` (etc.)

## 3. Change Principles

Any proposed change MUST respect:

1. **Glyph Stability**
   The meanings of 🪨, 🖍️, 🔧, 🎮, 🌐 are **not negotiable**.

2. **Human Readability**
   Changes should not make CaveCode harder for non-coders to understand.

3. **Device Agnosticism**
   The protocol must remain implementable on low-power devices and phones.

4. **AI Cooperation**
   The format must remain easy for AI agents to read and generate.

5. **Repository Truth**
   A protocol change is not complete until this repository's Master Project
   Map describes the resulting state in the same commit.

---

## 4. Community Input

While this repository is stewarded by SageWire Syndicate, outside
contributors may:

- open issues describing real-world use cases
- propose improvements via pull requests
- share example CaveCode artifacts

Stewards retain final say over the official spec, but real usage informs
future versions.

---

## 5. Compliance & Badges

Projects MAY advertise compliance using badges from `/badges/`.

- “CaveCode Compliant” — uses glyphs and blocks per spec.
- “CaveCode Inside” — uses CaveCode internally for architecture.

Badges are a **signal**, not a legal certification.

---

## 6. Deviation & Forks

Anyone may:

- fork this repo
- create alternate conventions
- experiment with new glyphs

However, they MUST NOT claim to be “CaveCode v1.x compliant” if they
change the meaning of the standard glyphs.

They are encouraged instead to:

- link back to this repo as the original spec
- describe their work as “CaveCode-inspired” or “CaveCode-derived”

---

## 7. Ratification and history

Draft documentation, examples, tools, builder logs, and founding declarations
do not become normative merely by being committed. A protocol rule becomes
normative when the steward records it in the ratified specification and updates
the repository Master Project Map.

Historical files remain valuable evidence of how CaveCode developed. When
history conflicts with the current ratified contract, preserve the history and
label its authority accurately rather than silently rewriting it.
