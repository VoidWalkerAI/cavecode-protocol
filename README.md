📜 CaveCode Protocol

A SageWire Syndicate Specification

CaveCode is a plain-text blueprint format for describing systems, tools, utilities, and games in a way that:

humans can read and edit on a phone

AIs can consistently generate and parse

teams can remix, validate, and build upon

multiple engines (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.) can speak a shared standard


It is not a programming language.
It sits beside the code as a structured description: numbered blocks with clear labels, emoji glyphs, and a dedicated human edit zone.

🧱 CaveCode Structure (Spec v1.1)

Core blocks:

🪨 SHELL – structural wrapper

🔧 BEHAVIOR – logic, flow, or step definitions

🎚️ TUNING KNOBS – human-editable values

🌐 PUBLIC TEXT – labels, UI strings, dialog, etc.

📝 HUMAN NOTES – comments, ideas, TODOs


Official glyphs:

🪨 structural / shell

🔧 behavior / game loop / program flow

🎚️ knobs (safe for humans to edit)

🌐 public text (UI, labels, copy)

📝 human notes


These glyphs give structure at a glance—even on mobile.

📦 This Repo Contains

the spec and teaching docs

a scaffold tool to generate new cards

a validator (minimal + strict v1.1)

a fixer/normalizer for misaligned cards (coming soon)

examples generated by humans and multiple AIs

foundational reference cards for research and testing


This repository will grow as more AIs generate artifacts and more humans iterate on the protocol.


---

🚀 Quick Start

1. Generate a new CaveCode card

From the repo root:

python tools/scaffold/cavecode_new_card.py "My Artifact Name" my-artifact-folder

This will create a valid, ready-to-edit .cavecode file with full block structure.
