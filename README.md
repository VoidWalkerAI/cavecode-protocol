📜 CaveCode Protocol

A SageWire Syndicate Specification

CaveCode is a plain-text blueprint format for describing systems, tools, utilities, and games in a way that:

humans can read and edit on a phone

AIs can consistently generate and parse

teams can remix, validate, and build upon

multiple engines (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.) can speak a shared standard


It is not a programming language.
It sits beside the code as a structured description: numbered blocks with clear labels, emoji glyphs, and a dedicated human edit zone.

### 🧭 Why CaveCode Exists

Other formats (YAML, JSON, Markdown) describe data.

CaveCode describes **systems** in a way both humans and AIs can safely modify, remix, and extend — even on a phone.

CaveCode was built so:

- humans always know where to edit  
- AIs never overwrite protected sections  
- structure is visible at a glance (even on mobile)  
- multiple engines (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local models) can speak one shared standard  
- artifacts can be audited, validated, and versioned without confusion  

CaveCode is not a programming language.  
It is the **meta-layer beside code**, giving shape to tools, worlds, games, logic, UI, and documentation.

It is the shared language of the Forge.

🧱 CaveCode Structure (Spec v1.1)

Core blocks:

🪨 SHELL – structural wrapper

🔧 BEHAVIOR – logic, flow, or step definitions

🎚️ TUNING KNOBS – human-editable values

🌐 PUBLIC TEXT – labels, UI strings, dialog, etc.

📝 HUMAN NOTES – comments, ideas, TODOs


Official glyphs:

🪨 structural / shell

🔧 behavior / game loop / program flow

🎚️ knobs (safe for humans to edit)

🌐 public text (UI, labels, copy)

📝 human notes


These glyphs give structure at a glance—even on mobile.

📦 This Repo Contains

the spec and teaching docs

a scaffold tool to generate new cards

a validator (minimal + strict v1.1)

a fixer/normalizer for misaligned cards (coming soon)

examples generated by humans and multiple AIs

foundational reference cards for research and testing


This repository will grow as more AIs generate artifacts and more humans iterate on the protocol.


---

🚀 Quick Start

1. Generate a new CaveCode card

From the repo root:

python tools/scaffold/cavecode_new_card.py "My Artifact Name" my-artifact-folder

This will create a valid, ready-to-edit .cavecode file with full block structure.

### 🛣️ Roadmap

**v1.1 (current)**
- Core spec (SHELL, BEHAVIOR, KNOBS, PUBLIC TEXT, HUMAN NOTES)
- Minimal + strict validators
- Scaffold tool for generating new cards
- Example artifacts from multiple AIs

**v1.2**
- Official linter / normalizer for misaligned cards
- Schema definitions for custom blocks
- Automatic card formatter for mobile devices

**v2.0**
- Plug-in block system
- CaveCode-to-code generators (“From card to CLI / app / module”)
- Multi-AI compliance suite  
- Formal submission guidelines for 3rd-party engines

CaveCode will continue to grow as more humans and AIs contribute artifacts and refinements.
