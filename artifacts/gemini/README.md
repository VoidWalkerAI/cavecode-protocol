🟣 Gemini Artifact Archive

CaveCode Multi-Engine Compliance Test — Gemini

This folder contains artifacts generated by Google Gemini as part of the
CaveCode Protocol multi-engine compatibility experiments.

The goal of this directory is to document:

Gemini’s first attempt at generating a CaveCode artifact

The raw, untouched output

The normalized v1.1-compliant version

Notes about drift, consistency, and cross-engine behavior


This folder helps answer the question:

> “Can CaveCode be spoken naturally by different AIs without special training?”

📂 Files in This Folder

1. gemini-link-tagger_raw_v1.cavecode

This is exactly what Gemini produced, unedited.

Characteristics:

Correct block ordering

Good knobs

Good behavior description

No glyph labels (🪨, 🎚️, etc.)

Injected a strange “google.com/search?q=URL” substitution in several fields

Otherwise structurally valid


This file demonstrates baseline, cold-start compatibility.


---

2. gemini-link-tagger_v1_1.cavecode

This is the Ash-normalized, spec-clean version.

Adjustments:

Added official glyph markers

Removed the incorrect URL substitution

Preserved Gemini’s logic and intent

Updated version tag to v1.1 to match spec

Ensured behavior block is readable on mobile

Ensured knobs follow comment conventions


This file demonstrates full v1.1 compliance.

🎯 Purpose of This Folder

This directory serves three purposes:

1. Cross-Engine Evidence

Shows that CaveCode can be generated by engines outside OpenAI, even with no training.

2. Protocol Drift Analysis

Documents small deviations (missing glyphs, URL substitution) so the validator and future teaching packs can be improved.

3. Research + Demonstration

Allows developers, researchers, and the general public to see real examples of:

raw AI output

normalized CaveCode artifacts

the difference between the two

how CaveCode keeps structure intact across models

📜 Notes on the Gemini Test (v1.0)

Gemini understood the block format immediately.

It followed structure without teaching pack assistance.

The only protocol drift was cosmetic, not structural.

This confirms CaveCode’s universal readability goal.

Future tests will validate:

Perplexity

Groq LLaMA engines

Claude Opus / Sonnet 3.0 advanced modes
